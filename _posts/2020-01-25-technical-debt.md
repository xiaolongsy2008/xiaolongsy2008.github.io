Technical debt is incurred when the software or system designers take **short-cuts** to ship a feature faster, increasing the overall complexity of the system. The goal is to optimize for the present rather than the future. In other words, it's the easier path that takes us to the end-goal faster but the resulting code (or design) is messy and complicated. It will require extra time in the future to add new features or to fix bugs. 

The most common reason why companies take on technical debt is to meet the time to market demands. "We must release this feature by February, or our revenue will take a big hit. Just hack it for now and we'll fix it later." Other reasons for incuring tech debt includes lousy design choices, poor programming, changing requirements or the presence of outdated libraries or frameworks that made sense in the past but have become a liability now.
