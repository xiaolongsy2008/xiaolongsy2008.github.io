description: A look at whether it is normal to expect software developers to work on weekends and learn in their free time.

Despite all the perks tech companies offer to employees these days (unlimited PTOs, catered lunches, refreshments, beer on tap, dog friendly offices, gyms, yoga classes), there is often an indirect or hidden pressure on software engineers to put in more hours or to code on weekends. Managers say things like: 

- "You can call me on the weekend or even at night if you have any questions. I will answer your phone because I'll be working anyways."
- "Sam is an amazing engineer. So dedicated and such a hardworker. He couldn't finish his tasks because he was blocked for two days by the other team so he spent all weekend coding."
- "I'm so proud of my team. They regularly stayed late and worked weekends to deliver on our roadmap."
- "We'll be using the new technology XYZ for this project. Why don't you start learning XYZ in your 'free time' (aka the weekend)?"
